In that link you can find de RasperryPI4B 5G HAT designed by Waveshare. They were very kind in selling the HAT without the M.2 chip,
to avoid imports issues related to homologation of chips by URSEC.

The HAT was installed easily and has 4 antennas, dual SIM, an extra power source USB-C togive stability and a FAN under the chip to 
cool the chip and the CPU of the Raspberry. 

It supports both M.2 Chip sizes of 42mm and 52mm, so it is versatile and Long Term Evolution as it supports all the range of 
technologies for mobile access like LTE-M, NbIoT, 4.5G, 5G sub6 and 5GmmWave.

The connectivity to the internet is really straight forward with the modem manager of Raspbian and it also supports the addition of extra
HATs over it, which make the system expandable for other development.

Next week a Cat 16 chip M.2 with 1Gbps download speed will arrive from US. I will install it and test it if possible in the Lab
to get 5 bands available and let it use carrier aggregation to reach the theoretical speed if possible.
