M.2 Chip Vendors
################

There are different vendors of IoT chips with a wide range of options for different technologies and applications.

We are interested in M.2 Form Factor LTE chips with Snapdragon Qualcomm chips embedded. The Snapdragon is the Killer App Chip
and it has homologations approved in Europe, USA and Japan. 

They support LTE Global bands, European bands, US Bands and Japan bands. They support FDD and TDD LTE Technologies and so the Global 
compatblity is guaranteed. 

They are also embedded in Laptops, mobile phones and IoT.

They have different form factors, Categories of LTE Terminals, different Global bands.

The M.2 form factor comes with a built in GLONASS system so GPS can be used with an external antenna for exact location.


VENDOR NAMES
############

The market is shared among a handfull of chip makers from China and other countries that use Snapdragon modem module embedded to help time 
to market and global scale supply.

This link shows the market share by vendor:

The main ones are:

Quectel
Fibocom
SimCom
Telit
Huawei
SierraWireless

They have differences in the way they implement IoT Cloud but the M.2 chips are similar. Only the price or availability can have an impact. 

For Quectel is difficult to get the right controllers for Linux. Quectel is represented by Argnetina so it should be avoided.

Telit is the one with more trajectory and it's represented by Brazil in South America.

Huawei is of great interest but at the same time it's of great concern due to the 5G blockade in USA, UK and Europe in 5G. It should be avoided.

An interrogant is if all the M.2 chips are made in TSMC with the embedded Snapdragon modem and with a different brand printed as the sole 
differenciator as all of the chips with similar specs, let's say Cat.12 M.2 chips are really similar in specs. 

Regarding the AT Commands the chips are designed to be future proof and the M.2 Interface allows an easy replacement of chips to 
upgrade for modern chips or try differnt chips for the optimization of the system.

All these chips require a 3 month long maximum period for homologation in URSEC to be imported by a person. A person can import a maximum of
3 chips per year.
