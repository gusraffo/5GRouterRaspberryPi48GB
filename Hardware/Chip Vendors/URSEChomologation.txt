The list of vendors for LTE M.2 form factor chips is really long if we consider the number of vendors and the different Category of mobile
devices for LTE. This means that the homologation process, which is purelly administrative in Uruguay and can take up to 3 months, which is usually
the time it takes. 

Another problem is that the homologation process requires to present the documentation of homologation in another country and that is not allways
straight forward.

All these factors add time that is not predictable for the project to test a great number of chips and evaluate which ones perform better under
the required specification of our project.

A direct communication via an audience with URSEC is required to speed up this process.

Homologation is a major show stopper in this kind of projects, not only in this one, but in any other LTE IoT project that may happen in Uruguay.

I have already the homologation for the following chips approved and are the only ones that can be imported with a limit of 3 per year in total or in only one import. I can't remember exactly the limitation at the moment.

Here is the list:


From this list the Huawei M.2 HUAWEI ME906S-158 4G LTE/HPSA+ Mobile Broadband WWAN Module B1,B2,B3,B5 is the one that has already been imported for
the first prototype.
