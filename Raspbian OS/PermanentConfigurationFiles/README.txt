In this folder all the files that are edited have to be logged in order to have a log of all the configuration and versioning of them
to be able to analyze problems and also have documented every step to be able to reproduce and improve future designs.

Documenting changes like adding a permanent route, changing a boolean variable are important. 

Even though the SD cards can be cloned to reproduce the same system in a mass scale, there might be different configuration setups that 
have to be considered like a version with only LTE, a version with WifFi6, a version with LTE+Ethernet, and variants that might appear 
during the integration process.
