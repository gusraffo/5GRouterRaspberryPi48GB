WiFi AP bridged to the wlan0 interface
######################################

I will try to replicate the configuration of the WiFi AP changing the parameters of the eth0 for the wlan0.

It is important to mention that in the mobile network, the IP is provided by the vEPC and so it changes as well as the Default Gateway.
This might add some thinking in how to resolve every time the modem is connected to the mobile network.

I will copy in this section everything from the WiFi AP bridged into the eth0 and make changes accordingly.
