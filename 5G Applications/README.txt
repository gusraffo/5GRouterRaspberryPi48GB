5G modules connect IoT devices to the cutting edge of cellular networks, with ultra-high data rates and ultra-low latency - enabling applications
as diverse as remote surgery, autonomous driving, virtual reality gaming, AI-driven smart manufacturing and robotics.

5G already enables data rate several times faster than LTE-A - typical download speeds for our 5G modules are 4.2Gbps in standalone mode, 5Gbps 
in non-standalone, and 7.5Gbps using mmWave - and 5G is forecast to rise to around 100 times faster than LTE-A over its lifetime, meaning 
near-instant retrieval of vast quantities of data. This enables for instance smart factories with high-res cameras and real-time video analytics 
to monitor almost every facet of their business, driving efficiency and innovation. Network slicing allow sectors with widely divergent needs to 
occupy their own individual corners of 5G networks, ensuring service delivery at the highest level without interruption. 
Consequently, for example, smart vehicles will be able to support ultra-reliable connectivity for mission-critical on-board services such as
safety telematics, while keeping passengers entertained with the latest streaming multimedia.

As 5G develops the commercial opportunities for those who prepare now will become truly vast. 5G connections will reach 10.3 billion by 2025, 
accounting for 29% of total connections and reaching 37% of the global population. By 2026, the addressable 5G revenue opportunity beyond 
connectivity provision is forecast to reach as much as $619 billion worldwide. As a pioneer of 5G IoT modules, Quectel can help organizations 
of all kinds become 5G-ready with our range of durable, secure and ultra-high performance modules - while our global R&D 
department (which spreads across three continents) ensures we can support the full range of 5G applications, and our dedication to customer 
care means we’re on hand to help your business with any technical questions you may have once you’ve begun.
