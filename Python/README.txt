It is the intention of this project to implement in a second stage Python programs that are linked to Flask Web GUI so that the user can have a 
clear visualization of the system status and can interact with it changing configuration, testing the system, and many other tasks.

The idea is to have an FUI for the user that is simple and can be understood easily by any user. Language will be spanish by default, though 
dual language may be introduced in a later stage.

Whenever Python can help in simplifing tasks at a higher level than Linux, it will be used and also it will help with the user GUI implementation.
