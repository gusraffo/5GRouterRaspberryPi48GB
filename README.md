# 5GRouterRaspberryPi48GB

This project has the objective of using RaspberryPi4b8GB as an internet Router and home Desktop.

The internet connection would be optionally as Gigabit Ethernet or 4.5G/5G M.2 form factor chips with Snapdragon Qualcomm modems as components of these chips.

In the development process it will be attempeted to have Eth0 + 4.5G modem added Upload/Download data speeds to improve fixed service upload specifically.

It can also be used as a Rural Router with Eth0 for connecting a Switch or PC/Laptop

In terms of WiFi, the Raspi4b has 2 interfaces dual band and they are 802.11ac, which is not WiFi6, but a WiFi6 M.2 form factor can be added via USB to improve even more the speeds in the order of more than 1Gbps.

The two interfaces can be configured as Hot Spots

Two monitors can be connected to it, a camera that can use GPU and Tensor Flow for AI image inference, for recognition of images, video, etc.

Audio jack included.

GPIO should be used with a HAT, that uses also a USB3.0 link, to mount an M.2 female interface with external antena ports and the micro SIM Card.

GPS is included in the 4.5G/5G chip.

As 5G chips are more expensive 350 dollars, compared to 25 dollars of WiFi6, this model of house/office router would allow a cheap solution as only one 5G Sub6Ghz chip has to be aquired is desired.

4.5G chips M.2 are have different categories with different max speeds in downlink and uplink and also have different cost gamma so the customer offerings can be wide.

The routing has to be modified according with the option chosen and there should be a web interface to be able to reconfigure easily.

Open Tier Systems will be used to create VPN network for private customers or companies and it also allows connectivity to the remote RaspberryPis for confiuration, update, support and also allow MQTT Server to be used to have the Raspberries subscribed to Topics in order to report information or other tasks like check connectivity, etc.
