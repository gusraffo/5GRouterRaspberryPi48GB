It is difficult at the moment to predict time lines.

After presenting the prototype we will ask for resources in terms of human resources as well as micro computers, chips and other stuff required.

Also there will be a need to activate 5 carriers in a production cell to test newer chips in 4.5G and later on 5G chips.


Division of project areas and roles:

Project Manager

All this project ideally will have an Agile approach with Sprints of two weeks. Requirements will not change durinf a sprint. Bugs will be
