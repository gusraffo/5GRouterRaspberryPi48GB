It is difficult at the moment to predict time lines.

After presenting the prototype we will ask for resources in terms of human resources as well as micro computers, chips and other stuff required.

Also there will be a need to activate 5 carriers in a production cell to test newer chips in 4.5G and later on 5G chips in real scenatios. As there
is a homlogation by URSEC for the chips there should be no issues that affect other users. The tests will be carried at a low peak houur after 9pm 
when most customers are in their houses with FTTH and the WiFi network.

Division of project areas and roles:

Project Manager

MQTT System Team
Networking system Team
Marketing Team
Comercial Team
DTD Team (RAN)
Linux Team
GUI Team
Customer Support Team
Chip research, homologation and import Team
Lab and Production Testing Team

All this project ideally will have an Agile approach with Sprints of one week. Requirements will not change during a sprint. Bugs will be
tolareated and left for future releases.
