Today is Wenesday the 24th of 2022.

The actual status is the following:

Raspi4b8GB running with RaspbianOS
There have been issues with the SD card while experimenting in the OS that caused instability and the system became a little unstable.
To solve those issues we are trying to burn new images of the OS Bulseye and start from scatch.
This helped to improve performance and we will move slowly to the following stages.

Following Stages:
#################

1) Install packages for the Huawei dongle modem. Modem maganger proved to be good for this dongle.
2) Install other packages that might be necesary according with the documentation in the packages folder.
3) Convert the WiFi 802.11c interfaces of 2.4 and 5GHz into hot spots.
4) Route WiFi interfaces in a way that one works with modem manager and the other with the Ethernet port. This will create some sort of
static load balancer. The devices connected to 2.4Ghz will go via Ethernet and the 5GHz devices via the Huawei LTE modem.


Next stages to be defined...
