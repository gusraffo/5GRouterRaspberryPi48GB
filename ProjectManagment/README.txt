The project dates will be updated accordingly with progress made in theoretical and integration aspects evolve.

At the moment there is only one develper working on the system development with one collaborator and the project is in initial stage.

We can estimate 3 months initially to have a prototype with some configuration options and tested in production in real life scenarios
with Shaggy antennas on the roof. For that we will use my house that is located 800 meters from the site and has some tree barriers that will 
act degradding the LTE speeds, as well as the FTTH home service with a CAT.6 cables.

All the hardware has been purchased by me as there is no budget for this project officially at least at this stage.

We hope that after having a porper prototype we will produce a video content in the form of a short presentation to show the performance of the system
with edition of video and include some PPTs on it. 

After that the project will be evaluated to proceed or be cancelled. So it is important not to go beyond the protoype phase.

The protoype will be an engineering sample for evaluation and will not have all the end user requirement in terms of GUI and configuration.
