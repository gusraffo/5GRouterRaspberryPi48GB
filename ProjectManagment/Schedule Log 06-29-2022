Project update:

1. The Waveshare 4G/5G Hat for Raspberry arrived on Monday.
2. The system was integrated with the Cat 6 Huawei M.2 Chip and it works fine with the HAT. The antenas are bigger, it can support 2 SIM CARDS.
   The HAT has an extra power supply for stability and a fan for Raspi and Chip refrigeration.
3. It was presented as a LTE device for 4.5G, LTE-M, NbIoT, 5G to the RAN team in ANTEL and they liked the concept.
4. The Github 5GRouterRaspberrPi8GB was made public and itÅ› available for collaboration under the GNU GPLv3 licences to anyone.
5. Next week the Cat 16 Quectel module will be arriving, supporting up to 1Gbps download in lab environment. I will integrate it and 
   run some test.
6. I aquired two Yagi plastic antenas for installation in the roof at 90 degrees angle between them for space diversity. 
7. Another email communication to URSEC was sent to try to push for a fast lane in the homologation of LTE and 5G chips for IoT. 
8. The Waveshare HAT seems to be responding fine so far. IT seems a pretty stable application.


Moving Forward:

1. Install the new chip Quectel 160RM-GL M.2 and test it.
2. Install the Yagi antennas in the roof and get the adecuate coaxial RG213 50 ohms.Price 165 uruguayan peso per meter.
3. Buy the pig tail to adapt for the SMA Male in the HAT antenna connectors.
4. Reconfigure the Gigabit Ethernet with DHCP and 1 IP for a laptop, as well as the DNS of google.
5. The configuration to toute packets from the laptop to the WWAN0 has to be done changing the ipforwarding to 1:
       root@raspberrypi:/proc/sys/net/ipv4# echo 1 > ip_forward
       root@raspberrypi:/proc/sys/net/ipv4# cat ip_forward
6. After that the Iptables, NAT and Masqarade have to be turned on in the internet interface:
       iptable -t NAT -i wwan0 outgoing -j MASAQARADE
7. At this stage the system should be able to give connectivity for the laptop and firewall should be considered to be configured.
