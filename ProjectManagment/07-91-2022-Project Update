Comments in the previous update.


1. Install the new chip Quectel 160RM-GL M.2 and test it.

UPDATE: Chip arrived, was installed and tested.

Raspbian with modemmanager does not connect to internet.

Ubuntu 22.04 was tested for packet network connectivity. It comes with a kernel that connects to modems without the need
of modemmanager. It was tested and it works fine.

In terms of speed of download and upload, considering itÂ´s a Cat-16, testing under the site does not go over 50Mbps download. But
it was compared to the iPhone SE 2020 which is also a Cat-16 and it has the same behaviour.

A drive test with the iPhone showed that the "adsl test" page was not reflecting the network maximum capacity. The iPhone was
tested with the OOkla Speed Test App and it reached 150Mbps 3 blocks from the site in the street. 

Ookla does not work in Linux, but a speed test command line app was downloaded and it was tested under the site. 



2. Install the Yagi antennas in the roof and get the adecuate coaxial RG213 50 ohms.Price 165 uruguayan peso per meter.

Still need the 50 ohms cable coaxial and the connectors. Antenna setup will be changed for a camera tripod at the floor level
to help move the setup to different environments for testing purposes. The roof idea is ok but is only for one place so it
doesn't allow for mobility.

UPDATE: We solved the Yagi antennas in a different way. The two antennas were installed at +45 degrees and -45 degrees in a cammera tripod at the ground
level and not on the roof.

The cables and pigtails were provided temporarily by other area to carry on testing. They were succesfully connected but not tested yet.



3. Buy the pig tail to adapt for the SMA Male in the HAT antenna connectors.

Still haven't aquire the connectors


UPDATE: pigtails were provided by another area and they will be tested soon.



4. Reconfigure the Gigabit Ethernet with DHCP and 1 IP for a laptop, as well as the DNS of google.

This worked fine once. Then there was a configuration issue. Had to revert to factory the SD card. 
 
The dhcp can be changed for fixed configuration and the eth0 can be statically configured in etc/interfaces.

The laptop has to be configured accordingly with ip, mask, gateway and dns.

It worked at some stage but then it didn't. Just a small change and then there was no way to get it back up.


UPDATE: We will soon change the OS to the OpenWRT with LUCi. The main processor of the Raspberry with all the OS and GUI is
not performing at the level it should in the packet forwarding point of view. 

There is a reduction in the speed provided to the laptop connected in the Gigabit Ethernet compared to the speed in the Raspberry
and we estimate the procesing capacity of the Raspberry microprocessor is the cause. That is why we will work on the build up 
of an OpenWRT router. It was not fully in the plans before, as the different components of hardware of the system was the priority.

Now that the system is completed from the hardware point of view, with the Raspberry Pi 4 8GB, the Waveshare 5G HAT, the 4.5G Quectel module,
the Yagi, coaxial and pigtails, the next phase will include testing with Ubuntu 22.04 and then with OpenWRT. As the Raspberry allows
quick change of micro SD memory cards, the two OS can be tested just by changing the SD card.


5. The configuration to to route packets from the laptop to the WWAN0 has to be done changing the ipforwarding to 1:
       root@raspberrypi:/proc/sys/net/ipv4# echo 1 > ip_forward
       root@raspberrypi:/proc/sys/net/ipv4# cat ip_forward
       
IP Forwarding can be changed in /etc/sysctl.conf file.    

NO UPDATE
       
6. After that the Iptables, NAT and Masqarade have to be turned on in the internet interface:
       iptable -t NAT -i wwan0 outgoing -j MASAQARADE
       
This is only for the NAT but it needs to connect the interfaces in both directions as well with a couple of lines.

It also needs iptables-persistent software to be able to save the configuration after reboot.

NO UPDATE: We will wait for the OpenWRT system to configure all this software routing issues.



7. At this stage the system should be able to give connectivity for the laptop and firewall should be considered to be configured.


I did't worked on the firewall yet. The ports are open I assume. Don't know even what firewall is operating on Raspbian yet.

NO UPDATE



Moving Forward last week:
#########################

1. A lot of progress was made last week with the arrival of the Quectel module and the antennas setup.



2. The packet forwarding between eth0 and wwan0 should be improved in OpenWRT due to reduced processor load due to OS and GUI in OpenWRT compared
to the Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop OS.



3. The modem manager accepts command lines via de mmcli and is very broad in options. The bands that can be used by the modem can be defined here.
This could be very important to activate all the bands for 5 carriers in carrier aggregation for the EM160-GL Quectel Cat-16 module, that
can get speeds up to 1Gbps in lab environment.

UPDATE: We will first test OpenWRT.


Moving forward this week:
#########################

1. Test Yagi setup with the Quectel module in my house 800 meters from the site in order to see the order of the speeds it can reach.

2. Start the research in building a router with OpenWRT and LUCi. Basic configuration and add-on functionalities.

3. Configure in
