The Sense Hat is a usefull simple interface that has a joystick for inputs and 8x8 matrix led RGB as well as Temp, Pressure, Humidity 
and accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope. 

Documentation can be found in the following link:

There is a simulator GUI to use to mimic the SenseHat for development of code.

A step by step tutorial is in the follwing link:

In this particular project for a 5GRouter there is limited used for all the funciotnalities. It can easily work loading packages and 
it runs pyhton scripts. Straight forward configuration.

It can be used to display messages as banners, display letters, multicolor display, 8x8 images and the joystick can be used for inputs

It could be used for example to display alarms to the user blinking in red and when the user press the joystick it can display the alarm
in a banner. It can be used to move inside a menu to change configuration options as it has left right up down and center press.

The other sensors don't seem at the moment to have an application related to this project.

The display on the other side can prove to be really handy for the user as an interface when no monitor or mouse is present to interact with
the system.
